# Comedian-RNN

In this [Notebook](https://github.com/samegreene55/Comedian-RNN/blob/main/Stand_Up_Comedian_CharRNN.ipynb), you can see how Rameez Rosul and I gathered and processed full transcripts from different stand-up comedians, built a character level RNN using textgenrnn, and generated text from the different networks.

(Warning: due to the nature of the transcripts, the model outputs some expletive language)
